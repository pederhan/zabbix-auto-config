# IMPORTANT

Need to fetch all hostnames from `hosts_source`, all hostnames from `hostnames`, then check which ones we should remove.

# PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA

* Synchronization object that lets us know when all sources have finished collecting at least once.


# MAYBE

* Remove `hostnames` table and instead add `timestamp` column to `hosts_source` table. Need to profile the performance impact of this change. If we do this, we have to check the value of the `sources` key for each item in the `hosts_source` table. Is that performant?
